Here's the stuff. 

Ideally, I'd like to add more stuff: 
1) Code:
  a. algorithms
  b. daily coding challenge updates/issues
    1. These are still a bit above me. Lots of problems involving trees and nodes. Need to find out what these are. 
  c. things I'm researching
  
2) Ideas for websites:
  a. something with menus
  b. something using a MEAN stack
  c. need to make a cheesy 90s website just because. 
3) Photo blog: 
  a. Nature
  b. Skies/clouds
  c. Camping


How about some images of 90s websites to use as inspiration. Recreate them in paint?
-or better yet, wordpad. as a .rtf
-or even better still, in the NeXTStep emulator in VirtualBox :)
